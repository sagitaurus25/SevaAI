I want to create an autonomous AI agent primarily for performing S3 workflows. Here are some workflows example: 1. Inventory Reports Workflow - Configure S3 inventory, Set appropriate output format (CSV/orc) and Schedule weekly frequency Example 2: Log Analysis - Query cloudwatch logs for error entries, Group by error type and frequency, Generate summary statistics, and Present actionable insights. Example 3: Lifecycle Management for logs, Create lifecycle configuration, Set transition rules to Glacier after 30 days, Configure expiration after 365 days, and Apply to log file prefixes. We want you to create an architecture and work to implement it. We prefer highly cost-optimized architecture that allows us to build more workflows and grow the footprint.

I'll help you create an autonomous AI agent for S3 workflows with a cost-optimized architecture. Based on your requirements, let's first explore the architecture and then implement it.

## Proposed Architecture

Let's design a serverless architecture that's cost-effective and scalable:

1. **Frontend**: Simple web UI for user interaction
2. **API Gateway**: Entry point for requests
3. **Lambda Function**: Core orchestration logic
4. **Step Functions**: For complex workflow orchestration
5. **DynamoDB**: Store workflow definitions and execution state
6. **Amazon Bedrock**: LLM for natural language understanding
7. **S3**: Target service for operations
8. **EventBridge**: For scheduling and triggering workflows
9. **CloudWatch**: For logging and monitoring

Let's start implementing this solution:

---

I see you have a lot of files related to S3 agents and Lambda functions. Let's examine some key files to understand the existing structure before implementing our solution.

---

Now let's look at the existing frontend to understand how users interact with the system:

---

Based on the files I've examined, I now have a good understanding of the existing S3 agent implementation. Let's create a more advanced architecture that supports the complex workflows you described while remaining cost-effective.

## Implementation Plan

1. First, let's create a workflow definition schema in DynamoDB
2. Implement a Step Functions-based workflow orchestrator
3. Create Lambda functions for specific workflow steps
4. Enhance the existing agent to support workflow operations
5. Update the frontend to display workflow status and results

Let's start with the implementation:

### 1. Create Workflow Definition Schema

---

Creating a workflow schema definition file to define the structure of our workflows in DynamoDB

---

### 2. Now let's create the workflow orchestrator using Step Functions:

---

Creating a workflow orchestrator that uses Step Functions to manage complex workflow executions

---

### 3. Now let's implement the Lambda functions for the workflow steps:

---

Creating Lambda functions for each step in our workflows

---

### 4. Now let's enhance the S3 agent to support workflow operations:

---

Creating an enhanced S3 agent that supports workflow operations

---

### 5. Let's update the frontend to support workflow operations:

---

Creating an enhanced frontend interface that supports workflow operations

---

### 6. Finally, let's create a deployment script to set up the entire solution:

## Solution Summary

I've created a comprehensive solution for an autonomous AI agent that can perform complex S3 workflows. Here's a summary of what I've implemented:

### Architecture

The solution uses a serverless, cost-optimized architecture with the following components:

1. **Core Agent Logic**:
   - Enhanced S3 agent that supports both basic S3 operations and complex workflows
   - Uses DynamoDB for knowledge base and workflow definitions
   - Leverages Nova Micro for natural language understanding

2. **Workflow Orchestration**:
   - Step Functions for workflow orchestration
   - Lambda functions for individual workflow steps
   - DynamoDB for tracking workflow execution status

3. **User Interface**:
   - Enhanced web interface with tabs for chat, workflows, and executions
   - Support for running workflows and viewing execution status

### Implemented Workflows

1. **Inventory Reports Workflow**:
   - Configure S3 inventory
   - Set output format (CSV/ORC)
   - Schedule frequency

2. **Log Analysis Workflow**:
   - Query CloudWatch logs for errors
   - Group by error type and frequency
   - Generate summary statistics and insights

3. **Lifecycle Management Workflow**:
   - Create lifecycle configuration
   - Set transition rules to Glacier
   - Configure expiration
   - Apply to specific prefixes

### Cost Optimization

The architecture is designed to be cost-effective:

- Serverless components (Lambda, Step Functions, API Gateway)
- On-demand DynamoDB capacity
- Efficient use of Nova Micro for NLP
- Knowledge base caching to reduce LLM calls

### Deployment

I've created a comprehensive deployment script that:
- Creates necessary IAM roles
- Sets up DynamoDB tables
- Seeds the knowledge base and workflow definitions
- Deploys Lambda functions
- Creates API Gateway endpoints
- Updates the frontend with the API URL

### Documentation

I've provided detailed documentation in the README file that explains:
- The architecture and components
- Supported workflows and operations
- Setup instructions
- Usage examples
- Extension points for adding new workflows and services

## Next Steps

To fully implement this solution, you would need to:

1. Run the `setup_workflow_agent.py` script to deploy the solution
2. Test the workflows with actual S3 buckets
3. Enhance the workflow definitions and Lambda functions as needed
4. Add more workflows based on your specific requirements

This solution provides a solid foundation that can be extended to support additional AWS services and more complex workflows in the future.
